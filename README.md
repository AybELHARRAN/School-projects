This python code is for scraping a famous moroccan website where you can buy different stuffs like phones, cars...

The website: https://www.avito.ma/

And for me, I've chosen to scrap informations about the Iphone 11. In order to have an idea of the factors that influence its price.

The 'iphone118.csv' file is what I've got after running the programm to scarp about 8 pages.
